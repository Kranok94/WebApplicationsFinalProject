		<b><i>Gadget XChange</i></b> is an event hosted by the <i>Student Council of Engineering in Digital Systems and Robotics and Engineering in Electronical Technologies</i><b>(SAISD-SAITE)</b>. The event consists on selling products (typically electronic products or related). People around Campus can bring their own things that they want to sell and they will be displayed on a stand put by the <i>Student Council</i>. Then, another person can buy that product for the price set by the owner.</br></br>

		For each product that is sold, the Student Council charges a <b>remuneration of 10% of the product's price</b> that is placed by the owner. Additionally, there is <b>$20 pesos</b> charge of <b>rent</b> for every product that is exhibited. The products that are available in the stand can be seen by clicking the <b><i>"Products"</i></b> button in the <b>Home Page</b>.</br></br>

		If you have any devices or products that you want to sell, <b><i>Gadget XChange</i></b> is the event that will make that possible.
